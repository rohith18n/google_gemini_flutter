# Wise Companion

Wise Companion is a Flutter app that lets you chat with AI using text or voice. You can send a message or record your voice, and the app will respond with an AI-generated reply powered by Gemini. 
  
To run the app, install dependencies with `flutter pub get`, then create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Gemini API key in the following format:

```env
API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
